PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project aims to create a C++ loan application system that stores customer’s user information, the amount applied and the status of the applications. The system’s main user is the clerk, who perform tasks such as adding new applications, deleting, storing, updating application’s statuses and more. The project’s goal is to create an easy-to-use application that stores a vast number of customers.

PROJECT DESIGN

Data Structure: Linked List
The linked list is suitable for this scenario because of its dynamic nature, allowing users to store an undeclared amount of customer’s applications.
